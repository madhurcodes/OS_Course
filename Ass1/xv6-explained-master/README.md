# xv6-explained

This project serves as an explanation for xv6.

It is based on the lectures of Dr. Carmi Merimovich, which are based on the source code of xv6, which is based on Version 6 Unix, which is based on a true story.

Note that the documents in the repository are updated during my xv6 course, so it is advisable to come back here once in a while to see if there's anything new.
