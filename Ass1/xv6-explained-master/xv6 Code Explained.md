Hello, world.

In this document, weâ€™ll attempt to explain the actual code of our beloved xv6.  
Not all of it, but some of the interesting parts.

God have mercy on us.

---

###`1217 main(void)`

The entry point of the kernel.  
Sets up kernel stuff and starts running the first process.

**1219**: set up first bunch of pages, for kernel to work with (minimal, because old harware has little memory)

**1220**: set up all kernel pages

**1223**: set up segment tables and per-CPU data

**1238**: set up the rest of the pages for general use (because until now we had just minimal, because other CPUs might not handle high addresses)

**1239**: set up the First Process

**1241**: run the scheduler (and the First Process)

---

###`2764 struct run`

Represents a memory page.  
A `run` points to the next available page/`run` (which is actually the *previous* page, because the first available is the last in the memory).

---

###`2768 struct kmem`

Points to the head of a list of free (that is, available) pages of memory.

---

###`2780 kinit1(void *vstart, void *vend)`

Frees a bunch of pages.  
Also does some locking thing (I'll elaborate once we actually learn this stuff).  
Used only when kernel starts up.

Called by [`main`](#1217-mainvoid).

---

###`2788 kinit2(void *vstart, void *vend)`

Frees a bunch of pages.  
Also does some locking thing (I'll elaborate once we actually learn this stuff).

###`5419 argfd(int n, int *pfd, struct file **pf)`

Gets the `n`th argument sent to the system call, as a file descriptor.  
Returns descriptor and the struct file it points to.  
(The only reason we need the file descriptor `pfd` is in case we're closing the file and need to make `ofile` point to null.)

---

###`5315 fileread(struct file *f, char *addr, int n)`

Reads from `f` to `addr`.

**5319**: make sure can read

**5321-5322**: handle case when file is pipe

**5323-5329**: handle case when file is inode:

- **5324**: lock the inode (because we must)
  
- **5325**: read
  
- **5326**: update offset
  
- **5327**: unlock the inode

Called by `sys_read`.  

---

###`5352 filewrite(struct file *f, char *addr, int n)`

Writes from `addr` to `f`.

**5358-5359**: handle case when file is pipe

  - **5374**: begin transaction

  - **5376-5377**: write
  
  - **5379**: end transaction

---

###`5264 fileclose(struct file *f)`

Decrements file reference count.  
When no references left, actually close file.

**5271-5273**: decrement ref count

**5275**: keep backup of struct file, because we're about to release the lock on the file table (and anything can happen after *that*)

**5278**: release file table because closing file on disk can take a long time

**5280-5281**: handle case when file is pipe (needs to happen once for `read` and once for `write` descriptors of pipe for it to actually close)

**5282-5286**: handle case when file is inode (using transaction because this can require writing on device)

---

###`5851 sys_pipe(void)`

Allocates two files (read pipe and write pipe).  
Expects a vector with two entries (from the input), in order to return the descriptors in.

**5859**: allocate pipe (creates 2 file structs)

(`poff` in an optional pointer to the offset of the found inode.)

**5020**: read single `struct dirent` in `dp`

**5022**: check whether `inum` of current `dirent` is active

**5024**: check whether name of current `dirent` equals `name`

If we found the droid we're looking for:

**5026-5027**: store offset in `poff` (if we supplied the optional pointer)

**5028-5029**: get actual inode

...And if we did not find it:

**5033**: return 0

---

###`5115 skipelem(char *path, char *name)`

A helper function that helps us take apart "long/path/names".  
**Returns** the value of `path` *without* the first part, and sets `name` to equal the chopped off head.  
(Ignores the first instance of "/" in the path: "**/**a/b/c" acts the same as "a/b/c".)

---

###`5189 namei(char *path)`

Returns the inode with the matching path.  
(If `path` begins with "/", looks in root inode. Else, looks in current working directory inode.)

---

###`5196 nameiparent(char *path, char *name)`

Returns the inode with the matching path *without the last part*.  
(If `path` begins with "/", looks in root inode. Else, looks in current working directory inode.)

**5198**: ask `namex` to do the work

---

###`5154 namex(char *path, int nameiparent, char *name)`

Returns the inode with the matching path.  
(If `nameiparent` is 0, finds actual inode. Else, ignores last part (for case when we want to *create* a *new* inode).)

**5158-5161**: check if we need to look in root or current working directory

**5163-5180**: loop over parts in path:

- **5164**: `ilock` current inode, because we must

- **5165-5168**: make sure we're looking at a *directory*

- **5169-5173**: if we're looking for all but last (and found it), return it

- **5174-5177**: try to get the next part of the path under the current inode

- **5179**: set current inode to be the found path part inode

**5181-5184**: if looking for all but last (and haven't found id before), return 0

**5185**: happily return our found inode

---

###`5052 dirlink(struct inode *dp, char *name, uint inum)`

**5065-5070**: find empty slot in inode

**5072**: prepare to write name

**5073**: prepare to write inum

---

###`5657 create(char *path, short type, short major, short minor)`

Creates and returns inode supplied in `path` (expecting `path` to exist up to its last part, which is the inode we're creating).  
If inode already exists, opens it.

**5663**: get parent of requested inode

**5667-5674**: check if inode exists (and is a file!)  
If so, return it.  
If exists but is not file, return 0.

**5676**: get an actual inode from the disk

**5679**: lock the new inode (because we must)

**5680-5682**: set some values. nlink is 1, because parent is linked to new inode

**5683**: updates new values in the disk

**5689**: add the two links every directory has:

- "." self

- ".." parent

**5693**: add the new inode to parent

---

###`4654 iget(uint dev, uint inum)`

Opens (and returns) inode.

**4661-4670**: loop over `icache`, looking if inode was already loaded once

- **4663-4667**: check if the inode is already in the cache

- **4668-4669**: find first empty slot, in case we'll need to load inode to it

**4673-4674**: if cache is full (and inode not there), panic (although we could have also gone to sleep till there's room)

**4676-4680**: load some of the inode data to `icache`. Valid bit is set to 0, because we haven't yet read the data from the disk

---

###`4689 idup(struct inode *ip)`

Increments reference count of inode (and returns it).

**4691**: lock **`icache`** before use, because we access inode field

---

###`4756 iput(struct inode *ip)`

Decrements reference count of inode, and closes it on the disk if this it will no longer be referenced at all.

**4759**: check if:

1. We're about to close the inode's last reference
2. We're closing a valid inode
3. There are no more names of / links to the inode (so it must be destroyed)

If so:

- **4761**: mark inode as busy (since there's still one reference!), just in case

- **4765**: actually delete inode on disk

- **4767**: update the inode (???)

- **4770**: do something that isn't really needed

**4772**: finally decrement the ref count

---

###`4603 ialloc(uint dev, short type)`

- **4614**: calculate pointer to current inode (using casting so that `+ inum%IPB` will add the correct size)

- **4615**: check if inode is free. If so:

  - **4616**: clear inode data
  
  - **4617**: set type
  
  - **4618**: re-write entire block, marking new inode as used (because we set type)
  
  - **4619**: close current block
  
  - **4620**: allocate inode in memory and return the *memory* inode
